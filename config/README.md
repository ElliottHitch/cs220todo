# Configuration Directory

This directory contains configuration files for the application:

- **credentials.json**: Your Google API OAuth credentials (not included in the repository)
- **token.json**: Your authentication tokens (not included in the repository)

## Setup

You need to place your own `credentials.json` file in this directory. The `token.json` file will be created automatically upon first login.

Please refer to the main README.md file for instructions on how to obtain your Google API credentials.
